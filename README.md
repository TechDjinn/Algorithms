# Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or instructions designed to solve specific problems or perform tasks efficiently within computer science.

## Searching
Searching algorithms are methods used to locate a specific element within a data structure.
Understanding and applying the appropriate searching algorithm are a fundamental skill and are crucial for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### BinarySearch
Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, narrowing down the possible locations of the target element.

Scripted languages: 
- C
- Python

### LinearSearch
Linear search is a straightforward searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list.

Scripted languages: 
- C
- Python

## Sorting
Sorting algorithms are fundamental methods used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, based on predefined comparison criteria.

### BubbleSort
Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, gradually "bubbling" larger elements towards the end of the list.

Scripted languages: 
- Python

### SelectionSort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of an array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.

Scripted languages: 
- JavaScript
- Python
